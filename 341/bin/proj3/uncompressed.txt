According to studio estimates Sunday, "Iron Man 3" had the second-biggest debut ever, behind the $207.4 million start last year for "The Avengers," which teamed him with other Marvel Comics heroes.

Opening a week earlier overseas, "Iron Man 3" has hauled in $504.8 million internationally, giving the blockbuster a worldwide total of $680.1 million.
